## Concept: A gamified app that makes reading fun and addictive

<p>This is a very recently created React project template. This read-me maps out key features to be implemented.
<br>✦ Streaks + Calendar Grid (similar to GitHub's green squares) to encourage daily reading
<br>✦ Ability to track book progress (titles can be saved as currently reading, want to read, dropped, or completed)
<br>✦ Note-taking feature allows users to write notes on what they've read and document their progress by saving the page they're on
<br>✦ When a user wants to be inspired, the app generates a random broad reading prompt (Example: read a mystery novel that was published before 1998, read a non-fiction book by an author who's name starts with P).
<br>✦ Stretch goal: In an ideal world, I'd also like to implement a function that allows the app to provide custom reading suggestions based on their preferences
